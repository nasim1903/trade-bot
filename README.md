# MT5 EURUSD Trading Bot

This is a Python trading bot that uses the `mt5` library and the `backtrader` library to trade the EURUSD currency pair on the MT5 platform. The bot uses a simple moving average crossover strategy with the RSI and MACD indicators for entry and exit signals.

## Requirements

- The `mt5` library (version 5.0 or higher)
- The `backtrader` library (version 1.9.74.123 or higher)
- A MT5 trading account with EURUSD as a available trading instrument

## Usage
1. Import the necessary libraries: import `backtrader as bt`, `import mt5`, and `import pandas as pd`
2. Initialize the MT5 library by calling `mt5.initialize()`
3. Set the symbol variable to the currency pair that you want to trade (e.g. "EURUSD") and the timeframe variable to the time frame that you want to use (e.g. `mt5.TIMEFRAME_H4` for 4-hour candles)
4. Download the historical data for the currency pair by calling `mt5.copy_rates_from_pos(symbol, timeframe, 0, 365 * 24)`
5. Convert the historical data to a Pandas DataFrame with the correct column names (e.g. `eurusd_data = pd.DataFrame(eurusd_data, columns=["time", "open", "high", "low", "close", "tick_volume", "spread", "real_volume"]))`
6. Set the trading parameters, such as the lot size, take profit level, and stop loss level
7. Create a subclass of the bt.Strategy class and implement your trading strategy in the `next()` method. In this example, the `next()` method contains the logic for the moving average crossover strategy with the RSI and MACD indicators.
8. Create a `bt.Cerebro` instance and add the historical data, trading strategy, and starting cash balance. You can also specify the parameters for the moving average, RSI, and MACD indicators in the `cerebro.addstrategy()` method.
9. Run the trading bot by calling `cerebro.run()`
